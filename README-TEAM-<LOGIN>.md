## 1. **Exhaustive search algorithm**:
- two new datatypes symbolScript and modelScript are used to discribe the configuration of a SheetT.Model. a symbolScript contains all parameters that can to be changed, and a modelScript is a list of symbolScript, each for one symbol in the model

- function ___ is used to generate all possible symbolScripts for one symbol, and function ___ is used to generate all possible modelScript for one model

- function ___ is used to perform evaluation on all models, and return the one have the lowest overlapping number
  

## 2. **Heuristic Approach**
