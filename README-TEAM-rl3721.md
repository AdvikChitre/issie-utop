The team work is Test D3, done in the file [TestDrawBlockT3.fs](/src/Renderer/TestDrawBlockD3.fs)

 - A few metrics are set to determine the characteristics of wires that should be replaced by a pair of wire symbols. i.e what wires are classified as too long. Can be possibly used also in implementation
 - defined output metric of test
 - some helper functions to get to above output metrics (in progress)
 - some helper functions to build a sheet with random placements of components (in progress)
