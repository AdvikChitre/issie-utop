I am working on the implementation of D3

My work is in SheetBeautifyD3.fs

I have done some starter functions for the D3 deliverable, that can be used to partly implent the specifications 1 and 2 of D3.
For example, 
D3.1 :Identify long wires. Automatically replace with wire labels where there is room
I wrote functions to identify long wires, replace the wire with wire labels, and establish the position of the new wire lables implemented. Those functions also use my helper functions in SheetBeautifyHelpers
