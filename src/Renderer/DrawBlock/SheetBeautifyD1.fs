// visibleSegments would've worked, but outputs an XYPos list, which is a format that isn't well accepted by the other functions and types.
// This is achieved by utilising existing helper function segmentsToIssieVertices to convert all segments to a list of vertices.
// It is then very easy to remove duplicate vertices.
// We can utilise another helper function issieVerticesToSegments to convert vertices back to segments, and create new wires.
