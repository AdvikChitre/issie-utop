//-----------Notes for D1 From Ed-----------//
----------Dealing With Separation---------

Typically one problem humans find when trying to tidy up schematics is that there is not enough room in some parts of the sheet,
with components too close,  and everything needs to be rearranged.  Doing this automatically is problematic because changing relative
positions of components (except for a small amount) is multiply constrained.

Still there is one easy transform in line with "do no harm" which is to scale the whole sheet - already done by rotatescale if you select all components.

What might require scaling the sheet - uniformly magnifying the distances between all components?
If the "correct" positions of components to straighten connections cause symbol overlaps

If the separation between (parallel) wire segments and component edges, or segments and segments, is too small.
The wire separation algorithm should ensure that component-wire separation will be equally a problem is wire-wire separation is a problem -
so you probably need to consider only that. Scaling the whole sheet can make it difficult to see everything - if too much scaling is done -
so some sort of cap would maybe be necessary.

----------Dealing With Separation---------
2 quality metrics: no overlapping symbols, try to straighten wires as much as possible

The no overlapping symbols requirement is an extreme form of an enough separation requirement where for two adjacent parallel
symbol edges separated by distance d with n wires running through. The gap between them the separation  is:

d/(n+1)

Separations close to a defined minimum can be included as penalties in the objective function. Obviously separations below some
minimum value should not allowed, so a nonlinear dependence of objective function on separation could make sense and allow optimisation
techniques to be used.
