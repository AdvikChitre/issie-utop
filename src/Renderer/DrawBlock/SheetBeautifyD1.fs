//-----------Notes for D1 From Ed-----------//
----------Dealing With Separation---------

Typically one problem humans find when trying to tidy up schematics is that there is not enough room in some parts of the sheet,
with components too close,  and everything needs to be rearranged.  Doing this automatically is problematic because changing relative
positions of components (except for a small amount) is multiply constrained.

Still there is one easy transform in line with "do no harm" which is to scale the whole sheet - already done by rotatescale if you select all components.

What might require scaling the sheet - uniformly magnifying the distances between all components?
If the "correct" positions of components to straighten connections cause symbol overlaps

If the separation between (parallel) wire segments and component edges, or segments and segments, is too small.
The wire separation algorithm should ensure that component-wire separation will be equally a problem is wire-wire separation is a problem -
so you probably need to consider only that. Scaling the whole sheet can make it difficult to see everything - if too much scaling is done -
so some sort of cap would maybe be necessary.

----------Dealing With Separation---------
2 quality metrics: no overlapping symbols, try to straighten wires as much as possible

The no overlapping symbols requirement is an extreme form of an enough separation requirement where for two adjacent parallel
symbol edges separated by distance d with n wires running through. The gap between them the separation  is:

d/(n+1)

Separations close to a defined minimum can be included as penalties in the objective function. Obviously separations below some
minimum value should not allowed, so a nonlinear dependence of objective function on separation could make sense and allow optimisation
techniques to be used.

almost straight

    algo: check whether the wire travels furthest horizontally or vertically. This is the called the majority direction,
    and the other direction is the minority direction.

    * Not to be confused with the number of segments, e.g. there can be more vertical segments than horizontal segments, but if
    the horizontal segments cover a greater displacement, the majority direction is horizontal.

    Next, calculate the majority displacement, which is the sum of the segment lengths in the majority direction.

    After determining majority direction, ake sure the first and last segments are also travelling
    in the majority direction. Can be done by checking initialOrientation, and then making sure the length is odd.
    (in odd length, first and last segments will be in majority direction)
    If even, discard, can't straighten a wire that is 'diagonal/L' shaped.

    Then, check for the maximum deviation in the minority direction. If the deviation-to-majority-displacement
    ratio is less than a certain threshold, then the wire is almost straight.

(* algo steps

get all wires in the model
get the two symbols that the wire is connected to by InputPortId and OutputPortId

draft:
- To ensure InputPortId is singly connected: get the symbol that the symbol port is connected to.
    - Assume that InputPorts only have a single wire. Then check if the symbol with this inputport
     is singly connected. Do this by looking up the symbol's other portid in the SymbolT.model's
     InputPortsConnected and OutputPortsConnected. If they do not exist then the wire links to a symbol's
     input that is singly connected.
- To ensure OutputPortId is singly connected:
    - use isWireInNet in BlockHelpers to check if the net has more than one wire. If so, output port wire is
    connected to is not singly connected. Can skip the other conditions
    - If the net is singular, then check the symbol of the output portโ make sure all its ports are not connected anywhere
    else. Check the portids in the SymbolT.model's InputPortsConnected and OutputPortsConnected, same as above

shortcut:
- Note: these cases above apply to partially-done circuits where not all ports are being utilised by wires in the sheet!
- This will help with beautifying a partially-done sheet. Otherwise, it's much faster immediately check symbols that
   only have one port. Symbols in question: Inputs, Outputs, Viewers, Constants, WireLabels, Not Connected
- After all, completed sheets will have all ports connected to wires (or will have used Not Connected Stopper )
