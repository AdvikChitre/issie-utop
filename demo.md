The followwing features will be shown on the demo:

1. The D1 beautify function (wire straightening algorithm) on the A2 circuit in Appendix, with random vertical positioning of the Mux2's.
2. Two versions of the D2 beautify function (minimise wire crossings), one using an exhaustive search algorithm and one using a local algorithm. Two different test circuits will be used.
3. The D3 beautify function (wire labels) tested on the C1 component in Appendix C and an integrated test circuit.
4. An integrated test function, which runs D1, D2 and D3 at the same time. It is shown on the same integrated test circuit.
